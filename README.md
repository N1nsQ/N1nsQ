# Hello Stranger 👋  

My name is **Nina Tulilahti**, and I’m a **Junior Software Developer** with a passion for building clean, user-friendly, and reliable applications. I work as a **full-stack developer**, and my main toolkit includes **.NET Framework, React, TypeScript, SQL Server, and Azure**.  

In this portfolio, you’ll find a mix of projects from my ICT studies as well as personal experiments that reflect my curiosity and enthusiasm for problem-solving. I love learning and continuously developing my skills — not by chasing every new language or framework, but by mastering the tools I use and gaining a deeper understanding of how they work.  

Take a look around, and feel free to reach out — I’d love to connect with fellow developers! 🚀
